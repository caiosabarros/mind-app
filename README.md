My favorite project till now!

Why? Because of the goal: build an application that stores content inside tags for each user.

The app is deployed in Heroku:
https://mind-app-caio-sa.herokuapp.com/

I fixed more in my mind the concepts of migrations and was able to dive into many things I didn't know or which are not yet so much clear in my mind. But I've got a lot of progress on my Rails capacity! It was super fun!

Main gems that we used:
Devise
Bootstrap
RedCarpet

Things that were difficult for me:
Enabling the search bar to search for a tag and display only the contents with that tag.

Things that became easy:
Understanding the MVC workflow!
